  <section class="intro">
    <h2>What is Food Gardening?</h2>
    <p>
      Food gardening is a type of gardening that focuses on growing food crops. Unlike ornamental gardening, the main
      purpose of food gardening is to produce food to eat. It allows individuals and families to grow vegetables, fruits,
      and herbs for their own consumption while promoting sustainability and food security.

    <h2>Challenges of Backyard Gardening in South Africa</h2>
    <p>
      One of the main challenges of backyard gardening in South Africa is the lack of access to land. The cost of land in
      many urban areas is very high, making it difficult for households to start gardens. Another major challenge is
      water access â€” many households, especially in informal settlements, lack sufficient water for gardening. These
      challenges limit the growth of urban and backyard food gardens.
    </p>

  <section class="solutions">
    <h2>Solutions to Food Gardening Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      To address land challenges, it is essential to advocate for policies that promote equitable land access and secure
      land tenure rights. Communities and local governments can collaborate to create shared gardening spaces and
      community gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing water scarcity involves investing in rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation systems, and water-saving
      technologies. Encouraging greywater recycling and public awareness can also help improve water management in urban
      food gardens.

      <li><strong>Basic Hand Tools:</strong> Spades, shovels, and hand trowels for digging and planting.</li>
      <li><strong>Pruning Tools:</strong> Shears and clippers for trimming plants and harvesting.</li>
      <li><strong>Watering Equipment:</strong> Hoses, watering cans, and drip irrigation systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring Tools:</strong> Soil moisture sensors, thermometers, pH meters, and weather stations for
        tracking plant health.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Backyard gardening plays a vital role in combating hunger and poverty in South Africa. By promoting equitable land
      use, improving water management, and supporting local food production, food gardening can strengthen communities,
      promote sustainability, and contribute to a healthier future for all.
